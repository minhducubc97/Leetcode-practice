- Algorithm: There are 3 ways to do this problem:
  - My intuitive way: I notice 0 is the only obstacle that prevent us from reaching the end. Thus, I will traverse through the array, whenever I encounter 0, I will go back and see if any previous steps allow me to "jump" over this 0 step.
  - Another way I see as possible: Similar to JumpGame2, we can use Dynamic Programming here. However, this requires a separate min step vector, which takes space.
  - A recommended way by Leetcode: Use Greedy Algorithm. Have a tail pointer and go backwards; if previous step allows us to pass the tail pointer, make it the new pointer, and so on.
