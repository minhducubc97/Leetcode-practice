- Algorithm: O(m\*n)
  - Intuitive way: Traverse through the array, inserting the row and col to change into row set and col set. Then set those row/col to 0.
  - Smarter way: Traverse through the array. Instead of creating new sets, we make use of the original array: any row/col to be change, we will set the head of that row/col to 0, which serves a flag for us to know which row/col to set to 0 later.
  ```cpp
    if (matrix[i][j] == 0):
      matrix[i][0] = 0;
      matrix[0][j] = 0`
  ```
