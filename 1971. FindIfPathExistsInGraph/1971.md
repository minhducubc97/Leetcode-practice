1937.

- Algorithm:
  - Time complexity O(n)
  - Space complexity O(n)
    To traverse through the nodes, you need:
    - unordered_map (hash map): to store the possible vertices reachable from the current vertice
    - vector<int>: visited list to keep track
    - queue<int>: to do list (vertice to go to)
