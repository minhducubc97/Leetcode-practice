- Algorithm:
  - Time complexity O(n*k^2 + alpha) with k being the max length of a word and alpha the number of possible paths from beginWord to endWord.
  - Space complexity O(n*k) 
    Use 4 data structure storages:
    - unordered_set to store the list of words remaining for O(1) look-up time
    - unordered_set to store the list of visited words for O(1) look-up time
    - 2D array to store the answer
    - a queue for paths
      The queue will store list of current paths. Then go through the last words of those paths, and change each letter of the last word and do look up search in the remaining-word unordered_set, and also add that to the visited unordered_set.
