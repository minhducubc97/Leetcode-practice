- Algorithm:
  - Time complexity O(n + m) - the algorithm scans each vertex and edge once.
  - Space complexity O(n)
    In this problem, we need a good datastructure to handle accessing the same vertex several time. To address this, use hashMap.
    BFS: Use queue + hashMap
    DFS: Use recursion + hashMap
