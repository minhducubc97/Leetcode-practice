- Algorithm:
  - Time complexity O(n)
  - Space complexity O(1)
    Traverse to find both the start node and end node from root, while keep track of the direction string of both.
    Ex:
    startNode: LLRRL
    endNode: LRR
    Remove shared substring, in this case the first "L". Notice at the last shared letter (in this case "L"), startNode path and endNode path diverges. This means that to get to endNode, startNode only goes up. So we replace all remaining startNode string with the same number of "U", then concatnate with remaining endNode path.
