- Algorithm:
  - Time complexity O(n)
  - Space complexity O(1)
    There are two difficulties in this problem:
    - Traversing children nodes while traversing parent nodes
    - After a level is clear, jump from the last node of the previous level to the first node of the new level
      => We need 3 pointers. 1 pointer in the parent level, 1 pointer in the children level and 1 pointer for the start of the children level.
