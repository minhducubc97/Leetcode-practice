- Algorithm: O(n/2)
  - There are 2 important points of this problem:
    - The amount of water contained in a container is equal to the height of the lower barrier multiplying with the distance between 2 barriers.
    - We want to iterate in a way that there is always potentially a new container that can store more water.
  - At the base case, we start with the most obvious that the container that spans between the smallest index and the highest index is a potential condidate, since it has the biggest base. Now, we iterate inwards. We notice that the base is reducing, so this can only made up for by increasing the height of either/both of barriers, which means we should move the index of the lower barrier more inward and look for a new barrier that is higher than the current higher barrier, allowing us to get a new container that can potentially store more water.
