- Algorithm: O(n)
  - Intuitive way: Create a new array, then traverse through 2 arrays simultaneously to insert new element
  - Smarter way: Notice how they PURPOSELY make the first array longer to accommodate the result. The excess part, bunch of zeros, can be used instead of having to create a new array to store result. Instead of traversing from left to right to compare two array elements, you can go from right to left by making use of these zeros.
