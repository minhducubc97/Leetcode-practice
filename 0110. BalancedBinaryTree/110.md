- Algorithm:
  - Time complexity O(n)
  - Space complexity O(1)
    Basic calculating depth problem combined with recursive check. Note that root with two branches at the same height may not be balanced, since its subroot may be imbalanced. Eg:
    4
    / \
    3 7
    / / \
    2 6 9
    / / \
    1 5 10
