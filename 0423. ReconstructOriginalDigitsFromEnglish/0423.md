  - Time complexity O(n)
  - Space complexity O(n)
    The idea is to look for something unique. One could notice that all even numbers contain each a unique letter :
    Letter "z" is present only in "zero".
    Letter "w" is present only in "two".
    Letter "u" is present only in "four".
    Letter "x" is present only in "six".
    Letter "g" is present only in "eight".
    Letter "s" is present only in "six" and "seven".
    Letter "v" is present only in "five" and "seven".
    Letter "r" is present only in "three" and "zero" and "four".
    Letter "o" is present only in "zero" and "one" and "two" and "four".
    Letter "i" is present only in "nine" and "five" and "six" and "eight".
    Use frequency to determine which number is in the string.
