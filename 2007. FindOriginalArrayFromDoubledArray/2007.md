- Algorithm:
  - Time complexity O(n + klog(k)) with k = number of unique elements
  - Space complexity O(n)
    Naive approach:
    1. sort the array
    2. cycle through each element, binary search on the remaining array for the corresponding double element 3. remove both from the array
       Optimized approach:
    3. Noticed instead of find double element using binary search (log(n)), we put all element in hash map/hash set so search time would be O(1); since there is no restriction on the uniqueness of element, so we use hash map {element, frequency}
    4. Cycle through the key list of the map:
       a. if hashMap[element] > hashMap[element * 2] (aka original element has more duplicate than its corresponding double): invalid array
       b. decrease hashMap[element * 2] = hashMap[element], while also adding element to the result array
