- Algorithm: O(n)
  At first glance, I thought the problem can be solved in a similar fashion as Trapping Rain Water problem. Therefore, I started from the maximum element, then expand both sides, with priority given to the side with the higher bar values. However, this solution would fail in cases like [4,2,0,3,2,4,3,4], where groups of high values are separated by smaller values, so we would only consider 1 such group of high values.
  So, the solution to this problem would be a brute force method: instead of start from the center and expand both ways, I will start from left to right. Now, we can't brute force normally, since the area is bounded by the smaller values. So, we will make use of them as a lowerbound for the values that we will consider starting from the beginning. Now, everytime I encounter a value that is smaller than the previous value. I stop to look at all the possible combinations of previous values (that are higher than the current values and should be an increasing array), and update the current max area.
