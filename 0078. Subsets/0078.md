78.

- Algorithm: O(n^2)
  My intuitive way is to go with a similar approach to problem 77, with the introduction of curCount - the number of element in the current vector, levelSize - the number of elements in this level of the tree, maxSize - the maximum number of elements in a vector, aka the number of elements in the leaf of the tree. This, however, can be optimized away, if we just add current vector to the result as we go.
