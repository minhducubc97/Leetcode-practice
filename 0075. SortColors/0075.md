- Algorithm: O(n)
  To only traverse the nums array once, we will need to do 3 things while traversing:
  - 1 pointer pointing to the end of group of 0s. This group will be on the LHS. Increment the pointer as we swap other 0s outside the group into the group
  - 1 pointer pointing to the head of the group of 2s. This group will be on the RHS. Decrement the pointer as we swap other 2s outside the group into the group.
  - We do nothing as we traversing through 1s.
