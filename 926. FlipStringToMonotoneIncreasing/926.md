- Algorithm:

  - Time complexity O(n)
  - Space complexity O(1)
    Let's study the behavior:
    f(1): 0 flip
    f(01): 0 flip = f(0)
    f(101): 1 flip = f(10)
    f(1001): 1 flip = f(100)
    f(1011): 1 flip = f(101)
    f(1111): 0 flip = f(111)

    f(0): 0 flip
    f(10): 1 flip = no of 1s
    f(110): 1 flip = f(11) + 1
    f(101010): 3 flips = f(10101) + 1
    f(101000): 2 flips = no of 1s

    => last digit == 1: same behavior as previous
    => last digit == 0: min(previous + 1, no of 1s)
