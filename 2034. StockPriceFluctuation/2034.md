- Algorithm:
  - Time complexity O(n\*log(n))
  - Space complexity O(n)
    I have been struggling with this question because of not knowing good data structures for this. I know I need a sorted vector and a sorted unordered map to do such things...
    Then turn out I need multiset<int> and map<int, int>, both are sorted on insertion, deletion. Most importantly, they handle the above operations in O(logn) (lol too OP)
