- Algorithm: O(n^2)
  - My naive approach: This algorithm is pretty much the same as Permutation's. The only difference in this algorithm is the inclusion of level vector, which keeps track of the current index and previous index levels in the tree, which allows us to eliminate duplications.
  - Optimized approach: No need for level vector. The visited vector stores info that can differentiate between 2 consecutive elements in consideration.
