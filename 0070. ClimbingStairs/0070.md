70.

- Algorithm: O(n)
  Notice: for the last addition, it can only be either sumSoFar + 1 or sumSoFar2 + 2. To get to sumSoFar, it will also be a similar problem, but the sum is now only n - 1; for sumSoFar2 is only n - 2. So the formular will be: climbStairs(n) = climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2)
