56.

- Algorithm: O(n\*log(n))
  There are 2 key things to consider in this problem:
  1. You can & need to sort the vector of vector of integer just by using the normal syntax (it sorts based on the first value of the sub vector)
  2. There are 3 scenarios of interval interraction:
  - One contains the other (e.g: [1,2] & [0,3])
  - Partial overlap (e.g [2,4] & [3,5])
  - No overlap (e.g [6,7] & [8,9])
