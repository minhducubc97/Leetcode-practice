- Algorithm: O(n^2)
  We will go cell by cell. When entering a number into a cell, we have to check 4 things:
  - If that cell is empty (1 line)
  - If the current row does not have that number already (1 helper function)
  - If the current column does not have that number already (1 helper function)
  - If the current 9x9 box does not have that number already (1 helper function)
    If all are true, then we can brute force a value from 1 to 9 into the cell. Then we move to the next cell doing the same stuff (indicating Recursion). Every iteration, we should also check if all cells have been filled, in which case, the sudoku has been solved (1 helper function).
