- Algorithm:
  - Time complexity O(n)
  - Space complexity O(1)
    I got the idea from Joma's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKO9UjSeLew&ab_channel=JomaTech), apparently this is called Floyd's Tortoise and Hare. But I call it double pointer.
    Have a fast pointer and a slow pointer. If fast pointer meets slow pointer at some point, there is a cycle.
