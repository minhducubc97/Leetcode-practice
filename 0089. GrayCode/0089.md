- Algorithm:
  - Intuitive way: O(n^2):
    - There is a pattern in the array number:
      n = 0 => [0]
      n = 1 => [0, 1]
      n = 2 => [0, 1, 3, 2]
      n = 3 => [0, 1, 3, 2, 6, 7, 5, 4]
      n = 4 => [0, 1, 3, 2, 6, 7, 5, 4, 12, 13, 15, 14, 10, 11, 9, 8]
      Everytime n increase, the output double in size. The new elements = 2^(n - 1) add to the old element, from right to left.
